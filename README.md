- Here i have implemented a shop cart that allows fruit to be added to a basket when the user interacts with it.

- There should be a discount for some products and this will be taken into account when the quantity is changed by the user.

- Ive made use of plenty of functions, methods and reusable code in this project. These functions can handle the calculation of the products and the discount along with it.
